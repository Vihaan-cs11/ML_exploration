In this project, we delve into the fundamental task of determining a line of best fit for a given dataset and explore two distinct methodologies to achieve this goal. The primary objective is to compare the accuracy and efficacy of employing linear algebraic techniques, particularly matrix operations, against leveraging machine learning algorithms grounded in calculus principles.

Linear algebra has long been a cornerstone of mathematical modeling, offering robust methods for solving systems of linear equations and extracting meaningful insights from data. By utilizing matrices and vectors, we can derive the parameters of a linear model that best fits the given data points, commonly referred to as the line of best fit or regression line.

On the other hand, machine learning techniques, particularly those rooted in calculus, provide a powerful framework for learning patterns and relationships from data. These algorithms, such as gradient descent-based optimization, iteratively adjust model parameters to minimize the error between predicted and actual outcomes, thereby yielding an optimal line of fit.

By juxtaposing these two methodologies, we aim to elucidate their respective strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for the task at hand. Through rigorous analysis and comparison of results, we seek to provide valuable insights into the relative performance and applicability of linear algebra and machine learning approaches in the context of regression analysis.
